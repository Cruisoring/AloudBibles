# AloudBibles


[Aloud Bible](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alouder.bibles ) was implemented with some unique features:
* Compared with other media file based apps, the fully wrapped TTS (Text-to-speech technology) can load TWO engines at the same time to read out two bibles of different language alternatively.
* Innovative SQLite+RandomFile storage: with only 100 Kb memory used to cache the content of a bible, the app responds extremely quick.
* I developed gesture detection to enable features like Zoom-In/Out and differentiate swiping of one finger and two fingers.
* C# WPF app to extract 50+ versions from plain text, XML and HTML documents. Noticeably, my XML parser can work 10+ times faster than DOM/SAX or any other open-sourced XML engines.
